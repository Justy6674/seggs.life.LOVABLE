## 📊 CURRENT STATE GAPS

### 🚨 CRITICAL REVENUE LEAKS:
1. **No usage limits** → Free users get full value
2. **No partner funnel** → Single signups, no viral growth  
3. **No paywall** → OpenAI costs without revenue
4. **No urgency** → Users delay upgrading indefinitely
5. **No social proof** → Missing testimonials/success stories

### 💡 CONVERSION RATE BASELINE:
- **Landing → Signup:** ~15% (industry standard)
- **Signup → Blueprint:** ~60% (high intent)
- **Blueprint → Partner Invite:** ~10% (BROKEN)
- **Partner Join → Upgrade:** ~5% (BROKEN)
- **Overall Free → Paid:** <1% (TERRIBLE)
