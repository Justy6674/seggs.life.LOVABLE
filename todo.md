**User-Driven:** Build what makes the "What should we try tonight?" question get amazing answers.  
**Quality Focus:** Every suggestion should feel like it was made specifically for that couple.  
**Non-Cringe Rule:** If it feels cheesy, clinical, or awkward, rewrite it.  
**Mobile-First:** Design and test on mobile, then desktop.
